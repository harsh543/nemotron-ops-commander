{"id":"INC-025","title":"AWS S3 request throttling causing backup pipeline failure","summary":"Nightly backup pipeline to S3 bucket prod-data-backups failed with HTTP 503 SlowDown errors. The pipeline performs parallel multipart uploads of database snapshots totaling 2.4TB across 12 concurrent streams. CloudTrail logs showed the S3 prefix prod-data-backups/daily/ received over 5,500 PUT requests per second, exceeding the per-prefix throughput limit. Approximately 30% of requests were throttled, causing the backup job to exceed its 4-hour timeout window and leaving partial uploads orphaned in the bucket.","source":"aws-docs","root_cause":"All backup streams wrote to a single S3 prefix (daily/YYYY-MM-DD/) which concentrated requests on a single partition. S3 supports 3,500 PUT requests per second per prefix but the parallel multipart uploads from 12 streams generated 5,500 PUT/s. The S3 request rate was not distributed across multiple prefixes, and the backup client did not implement exponential backoff for 503 responses.","resolution":"Restructured S3 key naming to distribute writes across multiple prefixes using a hash-prefix strategy: daily/{hash-prefix}/YYYY-MM-DD/. Implemented exponential backoff with jitter in the backup client using boto3 retry configuration with max_attempts=10 and adaptive retry mode. Staggered backup stream start times by 30 seconds each. Added S3 request metrics CloudWatch alarm for 503 error rate. Backup completion time reduced from timeout to 2.5 hours.","services":["s3-backup-bucket","backup-pipeline","database-snapshots","cloudwatch"],"service":"backup-pipeline","severity":"P2","timestamp":"2026-01-22T02:10:00Z","tags":["aws","s3","throttling","503","slowdown","backup","multipart-upload"]}
