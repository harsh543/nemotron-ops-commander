{"id":"INC-021","title":"AWS EKS node group scaling failure","summary":"Auto Scaling group for EKS managed node group prod-workers reached max capacity of 50 nodes. New pods remained in Pending state with FailedScheduling events indicating insufficient cpu and memory. CloudWatch alarms triggered for cluster-autoscaler but scaling operations failed with 'Maximum capacity 50 reached' error. The ASG launch template was configured with m5.xlarge instances and the max size had not been updated to match increased workload demands after a recent service expansion.","source":"aws-docs","root_cause":"EKS managed node group Auto Scaling group max size was set to 50 and never increased after workload growth. Cluster Autoscaler attempted to scale but was blocked by the ASG ceiling. Additionally, the ASG had a stale launch template version referencing an unavailable instance type in one AZ.","resolution":"Increased ASG max size to 80 nodes via eksctl. Updated launch template to use latest version with mixed instance policy including m5.xlarge and m5a.xlarge across all three AZs. Applied Cluster Autoscaler expander priority configuration to prefer cost-optimized instance types. Pending pods scheduled within 4 minutes of ASG update.","services":["eks-cluster","cluster-autoscaler","pod-scheduler","cloudwatch-alarms"],"service":"eks-cluster","severity":"P1","timestamp":"2026-01-08T03:22:00Z","tags":["aws","eks","autoscaling","node-group","capacity","cluster-autoscaler"]}
